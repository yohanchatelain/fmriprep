Usage
-----

Execution and the BIDS format
=============================

The ``fmriprep`` workflow takes as principal input the path of the dataset
that is to be processed.
The only requirement to the input dataset is that it has a valid BIDS_ (Brain
Imaging Data Structure) format.
This can be easily checked online using the
`BIDS Validator <http://incf.github.io/bids-validator/>`_.

The exact command to run ``fmriprep`` depends on the Installation_ method.
The common parts of the command follow the
`BIDS-Apps <https://github.com/BIDS-Apps>`_ definition.
Example: ::

    fmriprep data/bids_root/ out/ participant -w work/
