Installation

There are three ways to use fmriprep: in a `Docker Container`_, in a `Singularity Container`_, or in a `Manually Prepared Environment`_.
Using a container method is highly recommended.
Once you are ready to run fmriprep, see Usage_ for details.

Docker Container
================

Make sure command-line `Docker is installed <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.

See `External Dependencies`_ for more information (e.g., specific versions) on what is included in the fmriprep Docker image.

There are two ways to run fmriprep through Docker; the first, recommended way
is to use the `fmriprep-docker`_ wrapper.
This requires Python and an internet connection.

To install::

    $ pip install --user --upgrade fmriprep-docker

To run::

    $ fmriprep-docker /path/to/data/dir /path/to/output/dir participant

The second way to run fmriprep is to invoke ``docker`` directly. ::

    $ docker run -ti --rm \
        -v filepath/to/data/dir:/data:ro \
        -v filepath/to/output/dir:/out \
        poldracklab/fmriprep:latest \
        /data /out/out \
        participant

For example: ::

    $ docker run -ti --rm \
        -v $HOME/fullds005:/data:ro \
        -v $HOME/dockerout:/out \
        poldracklab/fmriprep:latest \
        /data /out/out \
        participant \
        --ignore fieldmaps

Singularity Container
=====================

For security reasons, many HPCs (e.g., TACC) do not allow Docker containers, but do allow `Singularity <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity>`_ containers.
In this case, start with a machine (e.g., your personal computer) with Docker installed.
Use `docker2singularity <https://github.com/singularityware/docker2singularity>`_ to create a singularity image. You will need an active internet connection and some time. ::

    $ docker run --privileged -t --rm \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v D:\host\path\where\to\output\singularity\image:/output \
        singularityware/docker2singularity \
        poldracklab/fmriprep:latest

Transfer the resulting Singularity image to the HPC, for example, using ``scp``. ::

    $ scp poldracklab_fmriprep_latest-*.img user@hcpserver.edu:/path/to/downloads

If the data to be preprocessed is also on the HPC, you are ready to run fmriprep. ::

    $ singularity run path/to/singularity/image.img \
        path/to/data/dir path/to/output/dir \
        participant \
        --participant_label label

For example: ::

    $ singularity run ~/poldracklab_fmriprep_latest-2016-12-04-5b74ad9a4c4d.img \
        /work/04168/asdf/lonestar/ $WORK/lonestar/output \
        participant \
        --participant_label 387 --nthreads 16 -w $WORK/lonestar/work \
        --ants-nthreads 16

.. note::

   Singularity by default `exposes all environment variables from the host inside the container <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/445>`_.
   Because of this your host libraries (such as nipype) could be accidentally used instead of the ones inside the container - if they are included in PYTHONPATH.
   To avoid such situation we recommend unsetting PYTHONPATH in production use. For example: ::

      $ PYTHONPATH="" singularity run ~/poldracklab_fmriprep_latest-2016-12-04-5b74ad9a4c4d.img \
        /work/04168/asdf/lonestar/ $WORK/lonestar/output \
        participant \
        --participant_label 387 --nthreads 16 -w $WORK/lonestar/work \
        --ants-nthreads 16

Manually Prepared Environment
=============================

.. note::

   This method is not recommended! Make sure you would rather do this than use a `Docker Container`_ or a `Singularity Container`_.

Make sure all of fmriprep's `External Dependencies`_ are installed.
These tools must be installed and their binaries available in the
system's ``$PATH``.

If you have pip installed, install fmriprep ::

    $ pip install fmriprep

If you have your data on hand, you are ready to run fmriprep: ::

    $ fmriprep data/dir output/dir participant --participant_label label

External Dependencies
=====================

``fmriprep`` is implemented using nipype_, but it requires some other neuroimaging
software tools:

- `FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>`_ (version 5.0.9)
- `ANTs <http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/>`_ (version 2.2.0-Debian)
- `AFNI <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/>`_ (version Debian-16.2.07)
- `C3D <https://sourceforge.net/projects/c3d/>`_ (version 1.0.0)
- `FreeSurfer <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_ (version 6.0.0)
